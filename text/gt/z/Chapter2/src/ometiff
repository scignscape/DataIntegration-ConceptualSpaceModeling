\p{Another dimension of cancer immunological profiling 
is the \q{Tumor Microenvironment,} 
which concerns the interplay between a tumor 
and surrounding cells, such as blood/lymph vessels. 
This environment is sometimes surveyed using high-powered contemporary 
bioimaging techniques, such as \q{Confocal Microscopy} --- a kind of layered 
imaging that acquires \TwoD{} scans at different depths, creating a 
\ThreeD{}-like model.  Image analysis is necessary to derive oncological findings from these images, looking not only for \q{Distinguished Regions} but also for linear paths and patterns (e.g., connective tissues or blood vessels).  As a result, Confocal Microscopy data involves both raw images and image-annotations that summarize image-analysis/Computer Vision results.  \lDICOM{} and \OMETIFF{} are examples of common bioimaging 
formats.\footnote{Robust image-annotation formats are not particularly 
well standardized (at least to a degree comparable to \sFCS{} or \sFASTQ{}), though some annotations can be expressed via 
formats such as \sDICOM{} Presentations, \sCOCO{} 
(Common Objects in Context), \sVOC{} (Visual Object Classes), 
or Annotation and Image Markup (the latter will be emphasized 
in later chapters).}}
