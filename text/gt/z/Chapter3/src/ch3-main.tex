\noindent{}This chapter will take a quick look at 
certain technological requirements associated 
with \q{precision,} \q{personalized,} or 
\q{patient-centered} medicine.  We will 
place emphasis on how the goals of precision medicine 
are advanced through bioimaging, and also 
on how precision medicine can influence 
trial design.  We use features of 
image-analysis and clinical trials to consider 
our overview of biomedical research methods 
initiated in Chapter 2.  We also discuss 
biomedical text mining as a further 
dimension in research methodology, 
summarizing the CORD-19 corpus on 
Covid-19 related research as a case-study.

\section{Introduction}

\p{This chapter will touch on research methodology and 
clinical trial design in light of Patient-Centered paradigms 
and Precision Medicine.  We will focus in particular 
on bioimaging/radiology, on trial architecture 
(particularly \visavis{} Covid-19) and on text and data mining.}

\p{After examining how Precision Medicine 
affects requirements for bioimaging software, 
we will consider patient-centered priorities 
in the context of clinical trials.  The goal 
of incorporating more granular patient-specific 
data within clinical observations in general 
translates over to clinical trials in particular, 
with trial-specific data models needing to 
incorporate patient-centered details 
at several stages, including recruitment
of patients for trials, information management 
while trials are being conducted, and 
subsequent follow-up studies and/or analyses.}

\p{This chapter will conclude by examining 
text and data mining techniques oriented toward 
biomedical publications and data sets, on the 
premise that text and data mining represent a 
computationally sophisticated methodology in 
their own right.  We will focus, as a 
case-study, on \Cnineteen{}, a large corpus 
of open-access Covid-related articles.}
